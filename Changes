Revision history for RT-Extension-MandatoryOnTransition

0.21 2021-10-29
 - Call RT method CustomFieldValueIsEmpty to perform additional custom
   field checks. This specifically improves checks for date custom fields
   because if RT can't parse the provided date value, it will mark the CF as
   "empty" and correctly fail the mandatory check.
 - Allow rules targeted to when a ticket is first created

0.20 2020-07-20
 - Add RT 5 support

0.19 2019-08-19
 - Only check for mandatory fields on a status or queue change.
 - Process Content the same as RT, which includes clearing whitespace
   like spaces or carriage returns. Also clear automatic signatures before
   testing whether Content was provided. Note that this will result in a
   change in behavior if users previously were entering whitespace or
   including a signature to satisfy a required Content rule.

0.18 2019-03-06
 - Add support for all the roles as mandatory fields.

0.17 2018-10-26
 - Add support for Owner as a mandatory field

0.16 2018-09-19
 - Don't check permission to get queue name from ticket in RequiredFields

0.15 2017-05-04
 - Fix an issue where ticket updates would alter
   %CORE_FOR_UPDATE. This prevented status transitions when the config
   requires Time Worked and the user has entered a value for Time
   Worked.
