=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-MandatoryOnTransition - Require core fields and ticket custom fields on status transitions

=head1 RT VERSION

Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4

See below for some restrictions on RT 4.0.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This RT extension enforces that certain fields have values before tickets are
explicitly moved to or from specified statuses.  If you list custom fields
which must have a value before a ticket is resolved, those custom fields will
automatically show up on the "Resolve" page.  The reply/comment won't be
allowed until a value is provided.

See the configuration example under L</INSTALLATION>.

=head2 Supported fields

This extension only enforces mandatory-ness on defined status transitions.

=head3 Basics

Currently the following are supported:

=over 4

=item Content

Requires an update message (reply/comment text) before the transition.

=item TimeWorked

Requires the ticket has a non-zero amount of Time Worked recorded already B<or>
that time worked will be recorded with the current reply/comment in the Worked
field on the update page.

=item TimeTaken

Requires that the Worked field on the update page is non-zero.

=back

A larger set of basic fields may be supported in future releases.  If you'd
like to see additional fields added, please email your request to the bug
address at the bottom of this documentation.

=head3 Custom fields

Ticket custom fields of all types are supported.

=head1 CAVEATS

=head2 Custom field validation (I<Input must match [Mandatory]>)

The custom fields enforced by this extension are validated by the standard RT
rules.  If you've set Validation patterns for your custom fields, those will be
checked before mandatory-ness is checked.  B<< Setting a CFs Validation to
C<(?#Mandatory).> will not magically make it enforced by this extension. >>

=head2 Not all pages where you can change status are supported

SelfService, for example.  See L</TODO> for others.

On 4.0, Basics and Jumbo are not supported because they do not have the
needed code, which is present in 4.2.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

    Plugin('RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition');

For RT 4.0, add this line:

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition));

or add C<RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition> to your existing C<@Plugins> line.

=item Clear your mason cache

    rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

=item Restart your webserver

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

To define which fields should be mandatory on certain status changes
(either globally or in a specific queue) use the C<%MandatoryOnTransition>
config option.  This option takes the generic form of:

    Set( %MandatoryOnTransition,
        'QueueName' => {
            'from -> to' => [ 'BasicField', 'CF.MyField', ],
        },
    );

C<from> and C<to> are expected to be valid status names.  C<from> may also be
C<*> which will apply to any status and also tickets about to be created with
status C<to>.

The fallback for queues without specific rules is specified with C<'*'> where
the queue name would normally be.

Below is an example which requires 1) time worked and filling in a custom field
named Resolution before resolving tickets in the Helpdesk queue and 2) a
Category selection before resolving tickets in every other queue.

    Set( %MandatoryOnTransition,
        Helpdesk => {
            '* -> resolved' => ['TimeWorked', 'CF.Resolution'],
        },
        '*' => {
            '* -> resolved' => 'CF.Category',
        },
    );

The transition syntax is similar to that found in RT's Lifecycles.  See
C<perldoc /opt/rt4/etc/RT_Config.pm>.

=head2 C<$ShowAllCustomFieldsOnMandatoryUpdate>

By default, this extension shows only the mandatory fields on the update page
to make it easy for users to fill them out when completing an action. If you
would like to show all custom fields rather than just the mandatory ones,
use this configuration option. You can set it like this:

    Set($ShowAllCustomFieldsOnMandatoryUpdate, 1);

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

If you're just using this module on your own RT instance, you should stop
reading now.  You don't need to know about the implementation details unless
you're writing a patch against this extension.

=cut

$RT::Config::META{'MandatoryOnTransition'} = {
    Type            => 'HASH',
    PostLoadCheck   => sub {
        # Normalize field list to always be arrayref
        my $self = shift;
        my %config = $self->Get('MandatoryOnTransition');
        for my $transitions (values %config) {
            for (keys %$transitions) {
                next if ref $transitions->{$_} eq 'ARRAY';

                if (ref $transitions->{$_}) {
                    RT->Logger->error("%MandatoryOnTransition definition '$_' must be a single field name or an array ref of field names.  Ignoring.");
                    delete $transitions->{$_};
                    next;
                }

                $transitions->{$_} = [ $transitions->{$_} ];
            }
        }
        $self->Set(MandatoryOnTransition => %config);
    },
};

=head2 Package variables

=over 4

=item @CORE_SUPPORTED

The core (basic) fields supported by the extension.  Anything else configured
but not in this list is stripped.

=item @CORE_TICKET

The core (basic) fields which should be called as methods on ticket objects to
check for current values.

=item %CORE_FOR_UPDATE

A mapping which translates core fields into their form input names.  For
example, Content is submitted as UpdateContent.  All fields must be mapped,
even if they are named exactly as listed in @CORE_SUPPORTED.  A supported
field which doesn't appear in the mapping is skipped, the implication being
that it isn't available during update.

If your core field is called different things on Update.html and Modify.html
you will need to modify the Modify.html/Default callback so the the
extension knows what field to use.  Look at TimeWorked vs UpdateTimeWorked
for an example.

=item %CORE_FOR_CREATE

A mapping similar to %CORE_FOR_UPDATE but consulted during ticket creation.
The same rules and restrictions apply.

=back

If you're looking to add support for other core fields, you'll need to push
into @CORE_SUPPORTED and possibly @CORE_TICKET.  You'll also need to add a
pair to %CORE_FOR_UPDATE and/or %CORE_FOR_CREATE.

=cut

our @CORE_SUPPORTED  = qw(Content TimeWorked TimeTaken);
our @CORE_TICKET     = qw(TimeWorked);
our %CORE_FOR_UPDATE = (
    TimeWorked  => 'UpdateTimeWorked',
    TimeTaken   => 'UpdateTimeWorked',
    Content     => 'UpdateContent',
);
our %CORE_FOR_CREATE = (
    TimeWorked  => 'TimeWorked',
    Content     => 'Content',
);

=head2 Methods

=head3 RequiredFields

Returns two array refs of required fields for the described status transition.
The first is core fields, the second is CF names.  Returns empty array refs
on error or if nothing is required.

Takes a paramhash with the keys Ticket, Queue, From, and To.  Ticket should be
an object.  Queue should be a name.  From and To should be statuses.  If you
specify Ticket, only To is otherwise necessary.  If you omit Ticket, From, To,
and Queue are all necessary.

The first transition found in the order below is used:

    from -> to
    *    -> to
    from -> *

=cut

sub RequiredFields {
    my $self  = shift;
    my %args  = (
        Ticket  => undef,
        Queue   => undef,
        From    => undef,
        To      => undef,
        @_,
    );

    if ($args{Ticket}) {
        $args{Queue} ||= $args{Ticket}->QueueObj->Name;
        $args{From}  ||= $args{Ticket}->Status;
    }
    my ($from, $to) = @args{qw(From To)};
    return ([], []) unless $from and $to;

    my %config = $self->Config($args{Queue});
    return ([], []) unless %config;

    # No transition.
    return ([], []) if $from eq $to;

    my $required = $config{"$from -> $to"}
                || $config{"* -> $to"}
                || $config{"$from -> *"}
                || [];

    my %core_supported = map { $_ => 1 } @CORE_SUPPORTED;

    my @core = grep { !/^CF\./i && $core_supported{$_} } @$required;
    my @cfs  =  map { /^CF\.(.+)$/i; $1; }
               grep { /^CF\./i } @$required;

    return (\@core, \@cfs);
}

=head3 GetSubmittedValue

Return submitted value for given $TicketId ticket Id, $CFId custom field ID and $ARGSRef
You shouldn't need to use this directly.

=cut

sub GetSubmittedValue {
    my ($TicketId, $CFId, $ARGSRef) = @_;
    my $value;
    if ( HTML::Mason::Commands->can('_ParseObjectCustomFieldArgs') ) {
        # steal code from /Elements/ValidateCustomFields
        my $CFArgs = HTML::Mason::Commands::_ParseObjectCustomFieldArgs( $ARGSRef )->{'RT::Ticket'}{$TicketId || 0} || {};
        my $submitted = $CFArgs->{$CFId};
        # Pick the first grouping
        $submitted = $submitted ? $submitted->{(sort keys %$submitted)[0]} : {};
        $value = $submitted->{Values} // $submitted->{Value};
    } else {
        my $arg = "Object-RT::Ticket-".$TicketId."-CustomField-".$CFId."-Value";
        $value = ($ARGSRef->{"${arg}s-Magic"} and exists $ARGSRef->{"${arg}s"}) ? $ARGSRef->{$arg . "s"} : $ARGSRef->{$arg};
    }
    return $value;
}

=head3 CheckMandatoryFields

Pulls core and custom mandatory fields from the configuration and
checks that they have a value set before transitioning to the
requested status.

Accepts a paramhash of values:
    ARGSRef => Reference to Mason ARGS
    Ticket => ticket object being updated
    Queue  => Queue object for the queue in which a new ticket is being created
    From   => Ticket status transitioning from
    To     => Ticket status transitioning to

Works for both create, where no ticket exists yet, and update on an
existing ticket. ARGSRef is required for both.

For create, you must also pass Queue, From, and To.

Update requires only Ticket and To since From can be fetched from the
ticket object.
